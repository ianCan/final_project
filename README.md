Its a basic playlist app where you can add songs, playlist cover to tradck yolur playlists 

I used a node.js app for the whole thing and i think thats where my problems started.
Node.js seeemd like the easier choice of a framework to use but since i wouldnt have to deploy multiple things
This seemed to backfire when i tried to add things like api's and as you can see in my code i tried to emplement

I deployed my code on AWS using EC2 instances, S3 bucket, and a program called puTTy
An EC2 instance is an enviroment where you can deploy your code but to get my code there i had to put it in a S3 bucket which a cloud storage system
